You can add collaborators to an app by creating a Galaxy account that is owned by a Meteor organization and transferring the app to that organization account.

Galaxy organization accounts allow you to deploy, scale, and monitor apps with a team of developers. Note that you always log in as an individual user (organizations don't have passwords).
